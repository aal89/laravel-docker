# laravel-docker üê≥

Generic docker image for Laravel applications with minimal footprint and support for cronjobs.

### Features

Base image is an alpine image with the latest PHP installed. Alongside PHP a lot of other depencies are installed,
this way all the most common features of PHP are available. A cronjob has been setup which calls the internals
of Laravel each minute, working with `Schedule`s is now really easy, no more hassle with cronjobs!

### Usage

Create this Dockerfile in your Laravel application root directory:

```
FROM aal89/laravel-docker:latest

COPY . .

RUN composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

And thats it! Build, tag and run the Docker image and you'll find your Laravel application running on port 8189.

Optionally you could add in these steps to further optimize your Laravel application in production:

```
RUN php artisan route:cache
RUN php artisan config:cache
etc...
```

*Note:* if port 8189 is not a good fit or you'd like to launch your application differently, feel free to overwrite the `CMD` line with one of your own. Don't
forget to incorporate `crond` in there somewhere, otherwise your `Schedule`s won't run.

Try using this as a `.dockerignore` file for minimal clutter inside the image:

```
/node_modules
/public/hot
/public/storage
/storage/*.key
/vendor
.phpunit.result.cache
Homestead.json
Homestead.yaml
npm-debug.log
yarn-error.log
.DS_Store
.hg
.hgcheck
.hgignore
.hgtags
.vscode
.git
.gitignore
```
